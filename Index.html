    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p>I would advise a potential client to do several things. At first I would inform the client about the different risks that can affect the security of their website. 
        Before actually launching a web page, I would use CI/CD tools(Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration). This way I can make sure that the code used on the website has been approved by some security checks. This keeps every change in code either flagged for a rework or approved. It maintans reliability any change done to the code.
        If the website had a user site where they would login, I would recommend a third party authorazation. It is hard to crack, and keeps the users profiles safe. In addition to the open-standard autorization protocol, I would also request from the back-end developer to set a session for the user to be logged in, so his/her credentials won't be hanging in the browser for a long time. 
        I would also recommend using a third-party solution for sanatizing a code. You have to use a specific sanatization for a sertain type of code, for example JS, HTML etc. It is so that hackers can't type in a code that reaks havoc in the clients website without them knowing.
        
        Last, but not least, I would take in concideration what the website is for when giving advise on web secutity. Is it a website for a bank, or is it a blogsite for images of kittens?
